# Kirana-Billing-Product-using-scikit-learn
<b>Classification of products based on image using ML.</b>

<b>I have added the python code for classification of two Product using Scikit learn Python Libraries.</b>

<b>Import the necessary libraries which have been imported in python code.</b>

```
import threading, webbrowser

threading.Timer(1.25, lambda: webbrowser.open("http://localhost:5000/") ).start()
```

<b>The above two lines of code will help you in opening the webpage on default web browser while you start the flask server(If you don't need to open the webpage then you can change it in the "app.py" file after cloning the files).</b>

<b>"JORC_classifier.joblib.pkl" is model file here.</b>


<b>Read the Process Explanation.docx(will be added soon) which contains the detailed process of this project along with images.</b>
